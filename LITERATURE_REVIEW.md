- **Polarity**: Positive deflection
- **Scalp Distribution**: Maximal at central-parietal electrodes (Cz, Pz)
- **Elicitation**: Oddball paradigm (infrequent target among frequent non-targets)

**Cognitive Significance**
- **Amplitude**: Reflects "degree of information processing" and attentional resources
- **Latency**: Indicates "stimulus evaluation time and working memory updating"
- **Clinical Utility**: Longer P300 latency indicates "bad cognitive performance"

**Relationship to Reaction Time**

## Summary

This literature review covers the state-of-the-art in BCI research relevant to the NeurIPS 2025 EEG Challenge:

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Deep Learning Dominance**: CNNs (especially EEGNet) dominate EEG-BCI, with hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures showing best performance in 2024

2. **Cross-Subject Challenge**: The biggest challenge is generalization across subjects (30-40% performance drop), requiring domain adaptation techniques

3. **Transfer Learning Essential**: Pre-training on passive tasks and fine-tuning on active tasks is recommended approach for the competition

4. **ERP Features Matter**: Neuroscience-based features (P300, N200) provide strong priors for reaction time prediction (r = 0.6-0.8)

5. **Domain Adaptation Works**: MMD, CORAL, and adversarial adaptation provide 10-15% improvements in cross-subject performance

6. **Hybrid Architectures Best**: Combining CNN (local patterns) with Transformer (global dependencies) achieves state-of-the-art results

**Recommended Approach for Competition:**
- Hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture
- Cross-task pre-training on all 6 tasks
- Domain adaptation for subject invariance
- ERP feature fusion (P300, N200, alpha, beta)
- Ensemble multiple models for robustness

**Expected Performance:**
- Challenge 1 (Reaction Time): NRMSE 1.00-1.15
- Challenge 2 (Psychopathology): NRMSE 1.00-1.10
- Overall Score: 1.00-1.12

**To beat current best (0.976):**
- Need C1 < 1.00 (currently ~1.30)
- Requires strong P300 latency features
- Likely need subject metadata or advanced domain adaptation
- May require novel approaches beyond literature
