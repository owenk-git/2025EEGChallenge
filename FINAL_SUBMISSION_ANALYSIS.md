## üìä Complete History & Learning

### What We Tried (Chronological):

| # | Approach | C1 NRMSE | C2 NRMSE | Insight Gained |
|---|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Simple MLP | 1.10 | - | Baseline established |
| 2 | EEGNeX | 1.10 | - | Architecture matters less |
| 3 | CNN Ensemble | **1.09** | - | Best recording-level |
| 4 | Transformer | 1.09 | - | Attention doesn't help much |
| 5 | Domain Adaptation | 1.55 | 1.08 | Good for C2, bad for C1 |
| 6 | Cross-Task Transfer | 2.60 | 1.09 | Good for C2, bad for C1 |
| 7 | Hybrid CNN-Transformer | 2.60 | 1.46 | Complexity doesn't help |
| 8 | **Trial-Level** | **0.97** | N/A | ‚úÖ BREAKTHROUGH for C1! |

### Key Insights:

1. **C1 Breakthrough**: All previous approaches used **WRONG GRANULARITY**
   - Were predicting: 1 RT per recording (5 min, 30 trials)
   - Should predict: 1 RT per trial, then aggregate
   - Result: 1.09 ‚Üí 0.97 (11% improvement!)

2. **C2 Correct Approach**: Recording-level is RIGHT for C2
   - Externalizing is subject-level trait (not trial-varying)
   - Recording-level averaging captures stable trait
   - Domain adaptation helps cross-subject generalization

3. **Architecture vs Data Structure**:
   - Simple model + correct granularity > Complex model + wrong granularity
   - Trial-level simple CNN (0.97) > Recording-level complex hybrid (1.55)

## üß† Neuroscience Justification

### Challenge 1 (Reaction Time):

**Why trial-level works:**

1. **Pre-stimulus alpha power** (attention state)
   - Varies between trials
   - High alpha = drowsy = slow RT
   - Low alpha = alert = fast RT

2. **P300 latency** (decision time)
   - Different each trial
   - Late P300 = slow processing = slow RT

3. **Motor preparation** (readiness potential)
   - Trial-specific
   - Strong preparation = fast RT

**Recording-level averaging destroys all this!**

### Challenge 2 (Externalizing):

**Why recording-level works:**

1. **Personality trait** (stable over time)
   - Same value for all recordings of a subject
   - Reflects chronic patterns

2. **Spectral signatures** (resting state)
   - Alpha/beta/theta patterns
   - Averaged over recording captures trait

3. **Cross-subject variation** (main challenge)
   - Domain adaptation helps generalization

## üìÅ Final Submission Files

### For Challenge 1:
```bash
# Single command to create C1 submission
python3 FINAL_C1_SUBMISSION.py \
    --model_path checkpoints/trial_level_c1_best.pt \
    --output_dir submissions \
    --device cuda
```

**Output**: `submissions/c1_trial_level_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.zip`

**What it does:**
1. Loads trial-level model (Val NRMSE: 0.9693)
2. Loads test dataset
3. For each test recording:
   - Extracts ~20-30 individual trials
   - Predicts RT for each trial
   - Takes median of trial predictions
4. Saves predictions and creates zip

### For Challenge 2:
```bash
# Single command to create C2 submission
python3 FINAL_C2_SUBMISSION.py \
    --output_dir submissions \
    --device cuda
```

**Output**: `submissions/c2_ensemble_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.zip`

**What it does:**
1. Auto-detects available C2 models in checkpoints/
2. Loads models (domain adaptation, cross-task, hybrid)
3. For each test recording:
   - Extracts recording-level features
   - Gets predictions from each model
   - Ensembles with weighted average
4. Saves predictions and creates zip

### Master Script (Runs Both):
```bash
# Creates both C1 and C2 submissions in one command
bash CREATE_ALL_SUBMISSIONS.sh
```

## üîÑ Submission Strategy

### Remaining Submissions:
- **Today**: 3 out of 5
- **Total**: 16 out of 35

### Recommended Order:

**1. Submit C1 Trial-Level NOW** (Highest priority)
```bash
python3 FINAL_C1_SUBMISSION.py
```
- **Why**: Breakthrough approach, 11% improvement
- **Expected**: Test NRMSE 0.96-1.00
- **Risk**: Low (validated at 0.97)

**2. Wait for C1 Results** (~30 min)
- If test NRMSE < 1.0 ‚Üí SUCCESS! ‚úÖ
- If test NRMSE > 1.0 but < 1.09 ‚Üí Still improvement
- If test NRMSE > 1.09 ‚Üí Debug (unlikely)

**3. Submit C2 Ensemble** (After C2 models finish)
```bash
python3 FINAL_C2_SUBMISSION.py
```
- **Why**: Solid approach, ensemble of best models
- **Expected**: Test NRMSE 1.00-1.05
- **Risk**: Low (validated at 1.08)

**4. Optimize Based on Results**
- If C1 test > 1.0: Try longer training (150 epochs)
- If C2 test > 1.05: Tune ensemble weights
- If both successful: Focus on small improvements

## üí° Future Improvements (If Needed)

### If C1 test NRMSE > 0.98:

**Option A**: Train longer
```bash
python3 train_trial_level.py --epochs 150 --batch_size 32
```

**Option B**: Data augmentation
- Add noise to trials
- Time warping
- Channel dropout

**Option C**: Ensemble multiple trial-level models
- Train 3-5 trial-level models with different seeds
- Ensemble their predictions

### If C2 test NRMSE > 1.05:

**Option A**: Optimize ensemble weights
```bash
python3 FINAL_C2_SUBMISSION.py --weights 0.5 0.4 0.1
```

**Option B**: Add subject features
- Age, sex, handedness
- Combine with EEG features

**Option C**: Multi-task learning
- Train on all 4 factors (externalizing, p-factor, internalizing, attention)
- Use auxiliary tasks as regularization

python3 FINAL_C2_SUBMISSION.py --device cuda

# Upload the created zip file to competition
# Expected file: submissions/c2_ensemble_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.zip
```

### Or Run Both:

```bash
# Create both submissions (C1 now, C2 when models ready)
bash CREATE_ALL_SUBMISSIONS.sh
```
