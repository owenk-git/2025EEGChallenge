# EEG Challenge 2025 - Project Complete! ✅

## 🎉 What We Built

A **complete training and submission pipeline** for the NeurIPS 2025 EEG Challenge with:
- ✅ **Trained model approach** (not random weights!)
- ✅ **EEGNeX architecture** with sigmoid-inside-classifier (proven: 1.14 score)
- ✅ **Full training pipeline** with data loading
- ✅ **Submission packaging** with proper weight loading
- ✅ **Git repository** at https://github.com/owenk-git/2025EEGChallenge

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/owenk-git/2025EEGChallenge.git
cd 2025EEGChallenge
bash setup_env.sh
conda activate eeg2025
```

### 2. Download Data
```bash
# Mini dataset (recommended for testing)
# Download from https://nemar.org
# Search: "HBN-EEG R1_mini_L100"
# Extract to: ./data/R1_mini_L100/
```

### 3. Train Models
```bash
# Challenge 1
python train.py --challenge 1 --data_path ./data/R1_mini_L100 --epochs 50

# Challenge 2
python train.py --challenge 2 --data_path ./data/R1_mini_L100 --epochs 50
```

### 4. Create Submission
```bash
python create_submission.py \
  --model_c1 checkpoints/c1_best.pth \
  --model_c2 checkpoints/c2_best.pth
```

### 5. Upload to Codabench
- File will be named: `YYYYMMDD_HHMM_trained_submission.zip`
- Upload to: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/9975/

## 🎯 Why This Will Work

### Problem with Previous Submissions
- **Sub 6 (ensemble): 1.18** - Models had random weights, not trained!
- Ensemble averaging only works with trained models
- Cannot train during inference phase

### Solution: This Repository
1. **Train models first** with real HBN-EEG data
2. **Save trained weights** to checkpoints
3. **Package weights** with submission.py
4. **Load weights** during inference on server

### Expected Results

**With Mini Dataset (R1, 20 subjects):**
- First try: ~1.3-1.5 overall
- After tuning: ~1.1-1.2 overall

**With Full Dataset (R1-R11, 3000+ subjects):**
- Expected: ~1.0-1.1 overall  
- Target: < 0.96 (top 3: C1: 0.944, C2: 0.999)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

**EEGNeX** (validated, scored 1.14 with Sub 3):
```
Input: (129 channels, 200 timepoints)
  ↓
Temporal Conv: 129 → 64
  ↓
Spatial Conv: 64 → 32
  ↓  
Feature Conv: 32 → 16
  ↓
Global Pool & Dropout
  ↓
Classifier: 16 → 8 → 1 (with sigmoid INSIDE for C1) ⭐
  ↓
Output: Scaled to (0.88, 1.12) for C1
```

**Key Innovation:** Sigmoid inside classifier architecture (not in forward pass)

## 📊 Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Mini Dataset (Days 1-2)
- Train on R1_mini_L100 (20 subjects)
- Validate architecture works
- Submit first trained model
- Expected: ~1.2-1.3

### Phase 2: Multiple Releases (Days 3-5)
- Train on R1, R2, R3 mini datasets
- Better cross-subject generalization
- Expected: ~1.0-1.1

### Phase 3: Full Dataset (Days 6-10)
- Train on full releases (100-250 GB each)
- Longer training (100-200 epochs)
- Expected: ~0.95-1.0

### Phase 4: Ensemble (Days 11-14)
- Train 3-5 models with different seeds
- Ensemble trained models
- Expected: < 0.96 (top 3!)

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. ✅ **EEGNeX is correct architecture** (research-validated)
2. ✅ **Sigmoid-inside-classifier works** (proven with Sub 3)
3. ❌ **Ensemble without training doesn't work** (Sub 6: 1.18)
4. ✅ **Must train on real data** (this repo solves it!)
5. 🎯 **Top teams trained on full dataset** (3000+ subjects)
