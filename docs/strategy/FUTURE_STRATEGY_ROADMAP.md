    GaussianNoise(std=0.01),      # Add noise
    TemporalCrop(crop_size=0.9),  # Random crop
    ChannelDropout(p=0.1),        # Drop channels
    TimeShift(max_shift=10),      # Temporal shift
]
```

```bash
python train.py -c 1 -o -e 150 --augment
```

**Deliverable**:
- Augmented model
- Comparison with baseline
- Submission if improved

**Expected**: NRMSE ~0.98-1.02

---

### Week 4: Ensemble & Refinement (Dec 6-12)

**Goal**: Build ensemble, maximize performance

# Train 5 diverse models
for seed in 42 123 456 789 1011; do
    python train.py -c 1 -o -e 150 --seed $seed --best_params &
done
wait

for seed in 42 123 456 789 1011; do
    python train.py -c 2 -o -e 150 --seed $seed --best_params &
done
wait
```

**Deliverable**: 10 models (5 per challenge)

---

#### Phase 4.2: K-Fold Cross-Validation (2-3 days)

```

**Deliverable**: 10 fold models (5 per challenge)

---

#### Phase 4.3: Create Ensemble Submission (1 day)

```bash
# Simple averaging ensemble
python create_ensemble_submission.py \
  --models checkpoints/c1_seed*.pth checkpoints/c2_seed*.pth \
  --method average

# Weighted averaging (by validation performance)
python create_ensemble_submission.py \
  --models checkpoints/c1_seed*.pth checkpoints/c2_seed*.pth \
  --method weighted \
  --weights 0.25 0.20 0.30 0.15 0.10
```

**Deliverable**:
- Ensemble submission
- Expected 5-15% improvement over single model

**Expected**: NRMSE ~0.92-0.98

---

### Week 5+: Advanced Techniques (Dec 13 onwards)

**Goal**: Beat SOTA (0.978)

#### Advanced Technique 1: Test-Time Augmentation

```python
def predict_with_tta(model, eeg_data, n_augment=10):
    predictions = []

    for _ in range(n_augment):
        # Apply random augmentation
        augmented = apply_augmentation(eeg_data)
        pred = model(augmented)
        predictions.append(pred)

    # Average predictions
    return np.mean(predictions)
```

**Expected gain**: 2-5%

---

#### Advanced Technique 2: Pseudo-Labeling

```python
# 1. Train model on training data
# 2. Predict on test data (competition test set)
# 3. Add high-confidence test predictions to training
# 4. Retrain model

# Risky but can help if test distribution differs
```

**Expected gain**: 3-7% (if test distribution differs)

---

#### Advanced Technique 3: Multi-Task Learning

```python
# Train joint model for both C1 and C2
class MultiTaskEEGNeX(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shared_encoder = SharedEncoder()
        self.c1_head = C1Head()  # Response time
        self.c2_head = C2Head()  # Externalizing

    def forward(self, x, challenge):
        features = self.shared_encoder(x)
        if challenge == 'c1':
            return self.c1_head(features)
        else:
            return self.c2_head(features)
```

**Expected gain**: 5-10% (if tasks are related)

---

#### Advanced Technique 4: Architecture Search

Try alternative architectures:

```python
architectures = [
    EEGNeX(),           # Current (baseline)
    EEGNet(),           # Classic EEG architecture
    DeepConvNet(),      # Deeper network
    ShallowConvNet(),   # Shallower network
    EEGConformer(),     # Transformer-based
    BENDR(),            # BERT for EEG
]
```

**Expected gain**: 5-15% (if better architecture exists)

---

#### Advanced Technique 5: Self-Supervised Pre-training

```python
# 1. Pre-train on large unlabeled EEG dataset
# 2. Fine-tune on competition data

# Use contrastive learning or masked prediction
```

**Expected gain**: 10-20% (significant but time-consuming)

## 🎓 Learning from Kaggle/Competition Winners

### Common Winning Strategies

#### 1. Ensemble Everything
- Top teams rarely win with single model
- 5-10 models in ensemble is common
- Different random seeds alone gives 3-5% boost

#### 2. Cross-Validation is Key
- K-fold CV for robust validation
- Prevents overfitting to single validation set
- Enables model selection

#### 3. Data is King
- Use ALL available data
- Data augmentation critical
- Balance classes/targets

#### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Grid search or Bayesian optimization
- Learning rate most important
- Regularization (dropout, weight decay)

#### 5. Test-Time Augmentation
- Almost always helps
- 2-5% improvement typical
- Cheap (inference time only)

## 📈 Monitoring & Debugging

### Key Metrics to Track

#### Training Metrics:
- Train loss (should decrease)
- Validation NRMSE (competition metric)
- Validation Pearson r (correlation)
- Val/Train gap (overfitting indicator)

#### Model Behavior:
- Prediction distribution (avoid mode collapse)
- Per-subject performance (identify hard cases)
- Subgroup performance (age, sex, etc.)

#### System Metrics:
- Training time per epoch
- Memory usage
- Data loading bottlenecks

### Red Flags 🚨

#### Overfitting:
- Val NRMSE increasing while train loss decreasing
- Large gap between train and val performance
- **Solution**: Increase dropout, add regularization

#### Underfitting:
- Both train and val loss high
- No improvement over epochs
- **Solution**: Increase model capacity, train longer

#### Data Leakage:
- Unrealistically good validation performance
- Huge drop on test set
- **Solution**: Verify subject-wise splitting

#### Mode Collapse:
- Model predicting same value for all inputs
- Very low variance in predictions
- **Solution**: Check loss function, add regularization
